conflict resolution

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "msg"
3. git fetch --> get update from online repo
4. git status --> check which files have conflict 
5. git pull -> git will try to merge your local with online
5a. if it fails -> open in IDE, >>>>>HEAD (conflict) lksajfioqwjefo <<<<
5b. save the file (Ctrl + S)

6. git add .
7. git commit -m "Resolve conflict on xxx"
8. git fetch --> get update (now should have no update)
9. git status --> your local repo is ahead of online 
10. git pull --> should show up to date
(if steps 8 - 10 show that there is still conflict, go back to 5)
11. git push (done)


- At the end of running command, the elevatorThread should notify Manager
- We want the elevatorThreads to set to idle when there is no command, and wait() 
	-> Manager needs to notify lift to activate them before sending command
- Create scanner console input to put into queue
